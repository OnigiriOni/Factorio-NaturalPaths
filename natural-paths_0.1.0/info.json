    "description": "While driving and to a lesser extend walking, the soil will degrade and form natural paths. Over time it will regenerate to its original form.\n\nFeatures different behaviour for walking and driving and a dynamically calculated regeneration path.\n\nThis mod is still in beta and might have bugs. Until full release, updates may break the regeneration process so take a look at the changelog."
