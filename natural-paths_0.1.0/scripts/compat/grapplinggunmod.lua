-- Grappling Gun mod

-- The grappling gun teleports the player over some ticks but the character is not moving in this time.
-- Since player.walking_state.walking = false, we do not need an additional check for this mod.

-- Returns if the player character is moving with the grappling gun and does not touch the ground.
function IsPlayerUsingGrapplingGun(player)
    -- Code here.
