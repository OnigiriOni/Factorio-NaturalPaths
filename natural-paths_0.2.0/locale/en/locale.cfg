natural-path--general--enableDebug="Enables debug commands and messages during gameplay."
natural-path--general--ticksBetweenUpdates="Updates every nth tick. Meaning a value of 1 executes the script every tick and a value of 60 executes the script once every second.\nDefault = 3600 -> once every minute.\n\nIncrease this if UPS are a problem.\n\nLower values will make transitions more smoothed (more single tile changes over time instead of one big change of multiple tiles) but there will always be texture plopping. So values too low will yield no visual benefit for decreased performance."
