# Factorio-NaturalPaths #
A mod for Factorio to dynamically change tile textures when driving or walking over them.

### Features: ###

#### Deterioration: ####
- Each vehicle has their own custom weight and other modifiers to impact the soil differently.
- Each vehicle has a certain pattern in which tiles will be affected for more variation.
- Walking will change tiles in a different way than driving, resulting in other end tile types.
- Inventory items influence the weight of the player/vehicle.

#### Regeneration: ####
- Tiles calculate a path from their current tile type to the original tile type via a tile-graph. This allows then to be modified however and still be able to return to their original tile.
- Tile types have their own regeneration time, so certain tiles will take longer to change textures than others.

#### Additional: ####
- Exclusion of certain surfaces to be modified.
- Exclusion of certain tiles to be modified.
- Exclusion of certain vehicles to modify tiles.
- Exclusion of certain mod movement options to modify tiles.

#### Debug: ####
- Prints various information about the mods functions during gameplay.

- **Able to reset all changed tiles to their original tile type in case the current state of the map is undesired or you want to safly unistall the mod.**
- Able to print a list of all vehicles in game with some information to make integration easier.
- Able to print information about the tile you are standing on.
- Able to print information about the table were tile information is stored to better understand and monitor performance.
- Able to set tiles around your position to a specific tile type to test regeneration functions.
- Able to print inventory weights of character or vehicles.

### Todo (More like this is interesting): ###

#### Feature ####
- Spread tile types as the car is moving.
- AI vehicles should apply deterioration as well.

#### Compatibility ####
- Make mod compatible with aircraft mods.
- Make mod compatible with surface/tile mods.

#### Performance ####
- Instead of changing all surfaces each update, change only surfaces a player is on. Accumulate changes on that surface and update it once a player is on it.
- Update chunks over multiple ticks to avoid lag spikes.


### Some Noteworthy Information: ###

#### Tiles: ####
- Factorios dirt tiles and some other tiles appear smaller after the correction pass when placed surrounded or next to grass. A 5x5 area will look like a 4x4 area.
